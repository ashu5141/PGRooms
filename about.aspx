             <p>At PGROOMS, we have a purpose – <span class="auto-style12"><strong>“we change the way young India is living by creating multiple verified stay options for them to choose, make sharing a habit by co-living”</strong></span>.</p><br />
   	 	<p>With the increasing number of students enrolling for higher education each year, the demand for student housing will witness a rapid rise and the company expects this trend will fuel its growth. The market is also witnessing a higher demand for student housing as residential facilities in the institutions are found to be in short supply and under-equipped. For corporate companies, PGO will act as a virtual buddy to support finding accommodation for their human resources predominantly young professionals.</p><br />
            <p>Co-living, like co-working and car-pooling, is the result of demand for more evolved rental housing solutions coming from students and young working professionals whose choices differ vastly. Currently, this new stay option is very popular with young aged anywhere between 18-30 years. Professionals who don’t live with their families in the city of work are also considering this option.
                Adding co-living, PGO will be the first integrated mobile application and website providing the variety of stay options to choose from private hostel/PG category, home run PG to company operated co-living spaces.
                Home Away? Go PGO way!</p><br />
